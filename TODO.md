## Session Notes

### Session 2025-06-29: Recovery and Phase 3 Notebook Development
- **Recovery Completed**: Successfully synchronized project state after codespace crash
- **Major Discovery**: Phase 2.5 was actually COMPLETED with 297 tests (vs 197 documented)
- **Notebooks Created**: 3 core demonstration notebooks for data engineers
- **Next Session Priority**: Continue Phase 3 with objects/relationships, devices, batch operations
- **Status**: Project in excellent state, ready for continued notebook development

### Development Notes
- Keep notebooks simple - they demonstrate and call utils functions
- Focus on practical API usage, not infrastructure complexity
- Maintain clean separation: tests -> utils -> notebooks
- Regular validation against OpenAPI specification
