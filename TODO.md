# Customer.IO API Client Library Development TODO

## Project Goal
Create a complete Customer.IO API client library using Test-Driven Development (TDD) in the utils/ directory, with Jupyter notebooks as the interface for data engineers to interact with the API.

- **Total**: 137 tests passing, clean TDD implementation

### Phase 2 Complete! ðŸŽ‰
All core API functionality implemented following TDD methodology.

### Next Priority ðŸ”„
- **Phase 3: Notebook Development**: Begin creating demonstration notebooks

### Project Health
- OpenAPI specification available: cio_pipelines_api.json
- Development standards defined: PYTHON_STANDARDS.md, ZEN_NOTEBOOKS.md
- âœ… Reset from over-engineered patterns to clean, focused TDD implementation

## Phase 3: Notebook Development

### Core Notebooks
- [ ] 00_setup_and_configuration.ipynb - Basic setup, authentication testing
- [ ] 01_people_management.ipynb - Demonstrate people API functions
- [ ] 02_event_tracking.ipynb - Demonstrate event tracking functions
- [ ] 03_objects_and_relationships.ipynb - Demonstrate object/relationship functions
- [ ] 04_device_management.ipynb - Demonstrate device management functions
- [ ] 05_batch_operations.ipynb - Demonstrate batch processing functions

### Example Use Cases
- [ ] Example: User onboarding workflow
- [ ] Example: E-commerce event tracking
- [ ] Example: User lifecycle management
- [ ] Example: Data migration patterns

## Phase 4: Integration Testing
- [ ] Set up test environment with Customer.IO
- [ ] Create integration tests with actual API
- [ ] Validate all functionality works end-to-end
- [ ] Performance testing for batch operations

## Key Principles to Maintain
1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, then implement to pass tests
2. **Simplicity**: No over-engineering, focus on API functionality
3. **Clean Code**: Follow PYTHON_STANDARDS.md exactly
4. **Clear Notebooks**: Follow ZEN_NOTEBOOKS.md for notebook design
5. **No Emojis**: Absolutely no emojis anywhere in code or documentation
6. **API Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of cio_pipelines_api.json endpoints

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete test coverage of all API endpoints
- [ ] Clean, maintainable utils modules
- [ ] Clear, functional notebooks for data engineers
- [ ] All code follows TDD methodology
- [ ] Documentation is clear and practical
- [ ] Ready for production use by data teams

## Notes
- Keep notebooks simple - they demonstrate and call utils functions
- Focus on practical API usage, not infrastructure complexity
- Maintain clean separation: tests -> utils -> notebooks
- Regular validation against OpenAPI specification
