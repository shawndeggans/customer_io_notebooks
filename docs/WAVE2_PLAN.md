# Strategic Plan for Customer.IO API Client Development Using Proven TDD Methodology

## Repository analysis reveals successful patterns

The `cio_pipeline_api` implementation demonstrates a highly effective development approach centered on Test-Driven Development (TDD) discipline, modular architecture, and direct OpenAPI specification adherence. The successful patterns include a clear three-module structure (transport, exceptions, client), comprehensive test coverage using pytest, and a strict module-first development approach where all functionality is fully tested before creating notebooks or examples.

The repository structure follows Python best practices with clear separation between source code (`cio_pipeline_api/`), tests (`tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`), and notebooks for usage examples. The implementation maintains **simplicity over complexity**, directly mapping OpenAPI endpoints to client methods without unnecessary abstractions or over-engineering.

## Three Customer.IO APIs require implementation

Analysis of Customer.IO's API ecosystem reveals three main specifications, with the Data Pipelines API already successfully implemented. The remaining two APIs are:

1. **App API** (including Communication Channels) - The most comprehensive API with messaging, campaign management, and analytics capabilities
2. **Reporting Webhooks** - Inbound webhook processing for message delivery and engagement events

The **Communication Channels API** (a subset of App API) should be the immediate priority as specified, focusing on transactional messaging endpoints that deliver Customer.IO's core value proposition.

## Phase 1: Communication Channels API implementation

### Module structure following proven patterns

#### Transport Module (`app_transport.py`)
Implement HTTP session management with Bearer token authentication, regional endpoint support (US/EU), and rate limiting (10 req/sec general, 100 req/sec for transactional endpoints). Follow the exact pattern from `cio_pipeline_api` but adapt for App API's authentication scheme.

#### Exceptions Module (`app_exceptions.py`)
Create Customer.IO-specific exceptions: `InvalidAPIKey`, `RateLimitExceeded`, `MessageNotFound`, `InvalidMessageFormat`, and `DeliveryFailed`. Each exception should include error codes and descriptive messages.

#### Client Module (`app_client.py`)
Implement core messaging methods:
- `send_transactional_email(transactional_message_id, **kwargs)`
- `trigger_broadcast(broadcast_id, **kwargs)`
- `send_push_notification(**kwargs)`
- `send_in_app_message(**kwargs)`

### TDD workflow enforcement

1. **Write failing test first** - Create test file before implementation
2. **Mock all HTTP calls** - Use pytest-mock to avoid external dependencies
3. **Test public interfaces only** - Focus on behavior, not implementation
4. **Achieve 100% coverage** - Every line of module code must be tested
5. **No notebooks until complete** - Resist creating examples before modules are done

### Testing structure
```
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── test_app_transport.py
│   ├── test_app_exceptions.py
│   └── test_app_client.py
├── integration/
│   └── test_communication_channels_workflow.py
└── conftest.py  # Shared fixtures and mocks
```

## Phase 2: Complete App API implementation

Extend the Communication Channels client to include full App API functionality:
- **People management**: Search, retrieve, update, delete operations
- **Campaign management**: List and manage campaigns and broadcasts
- **Segments and collections**: Audience targeting and content management
- **Metrics and analytics**: Performance data retrieval

Use inheritance to extend `CommunicationChannelsClient` into `AppAPIClient`, maintaining backward compatibility while adding new functionality. Continue strict TDD practices with tests written before each new method.

## Phase 3: Reporting Webhooks processor

Create webhook processing capabilities:
- **Signature verification**: HMAC SHA256 validation for security
- **Event parsing**: Handle all webhook event types (email, SMS, push, in-app)
- **Event routing**: Process and filter events by type
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of malformed payloads

Focus on security and reliability, with comprehensive testing of signature verification and event parsing logic.

## Phase 4: Integration and unified interface

Create a unified `CustomerIOClient` that provides seamless access to all APIs:

```python
class CustomerIOClient:
    def __init__(self, **config):
        self.pipelines = DataPipelinesClient(...)  # Existing
        self.app = AppAPIClient(...)
        self.webhooks = WebhookProcessor(...)
```

Implement cross-API integration features like person data synchronization and unified error handling. Create comprehensive integration tests that validate end-to-end workflows across multiple APIs.

## Critical success factors and lessons learned

### Maintain TDD discipline
- **Never write implementation before tests** - This prevents scope creep and ensures testability
- **Mock ruthlessly** - All HTTP calls must be mocked during development
- **Test coverage as a gate** - Don't proceed without 95%+ coverage

### Follow specifications exactly
- **No creative interpretation** - Implement exactly what the OpenAPI spec defines
- **Avoid premature abstraction** - Don't create base classes or frameworks until patterns emerge
- **Direct endpoint mapping** - One client method per API endpoint

### Module-first development
- **Complete modules before notebooks** - Resist the urge to create examples early
- **Integration tests come last** - Unit test everything first
- **Documentation through tests** - Well-written tests serve as API documentation

### Performance and reliability
- **Respect rate limits** - Implement client-side throttling
- **Connection pooling** - Reuse HTTP sessions for efficiency
- **Comprehensive error handling** - Every API error code must be handled
- **Regional support** - Proper US/EU endpoint configuration

## Implementation priorities

| Phase | Priority | Key Deliverable |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Communication Channels | **HIGH** | Core messaging functionality |
| Complete App API | **MEDIUM** | Full customer data platform access |
| Reporting Webhooks | **LOW** | Event processing |
| Integration | **HIGH** | Unified interface |

This strategic plan provides Claude Code with a clear, actionable roadmap that follows the proven TDD methodology from the successful `cio_pipeline_api` implementation. By maintaining discipline, following specifications exactly, and avoiding over-engineering, the remaining Customer.IO API clients can be built with the same high quality and reliability.
